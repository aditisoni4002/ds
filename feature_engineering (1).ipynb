        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In machine learning, a parameter is a variable that is internal to the model and whose value is learned from the training data. Examples include the weights and biases in a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "- Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables change together.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The loss value quantifies the error between the model's predictions and the actual values. A lower loss value generally indicates a better-performing model, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the true values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Continuous variables can take any value within a given range (e.g., temperature, height, price).\n",

        "- Categorical variables can only take a limited number of distinct values (e.g., color, gender, country).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Machine learning models typically require numerical input, so categorical variables need to be converted. Common techniques include: * One-Hot Encoding: Creates a new binary column for each unique category. * Label Encoding: Assigns a unique integer to each category. * Ordinal Encoding: Assigns integers based on the order of categories (if there is one).\n",

        "8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "- sklearn.preprocessing is a module in the scikit-learn library that provides functions and classes for data preprocessing, such as scaling, encoding categorical features, imputation, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A test set is a subset of the data that is held out and used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after it has been trained on the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "- A common approach includes:\n",
        "- Understanding the problem: Define the objective and the data available.\n",
        "- Data Collection: Gather relevant data.\n",
        "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data's structure, identify patterns, and find insights.\n",
        "- Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling.\n",
